Refrigerate for 2 hours or up to 4 hours. Allow chicken to reach room temperature before cooking. Stir maple syrup, butter, and sriracha sauce together to create the condiment. Set aside. Place 1 cup white rice flour in a bowl. Whisk eggs together in a shallow dish. Mix corn flakes, bread crumbs, Creole seasoning, 1\/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper together in another shallow dish. Drain chicken and discard buttermilk. Dredge a chicken tender in the bowl of white rice flour, shaking off any excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumb mixture to coat both sides. Place the breaded tender onto a plate. Continue process with the remaining chicken tenders. Run the tenders through the egg wash and dredge through the crumb mixture a second time. Tap and allow excess to fall off. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook bacon until slightly crispy and fat is rendered, about 4 minutes per side. Let bacon drain on a wire rack over paper towels. Increase heat to medium-high. Add vegetable oil to the bacon grease and heat to between 350 to 375 degrees F (175 to 190 degrees C). Fry tenders in the hot oil until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Place chicken on the rack with the bacon. Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Whisk egg whites and cream of tartar on medium high speed in the bowl of a stand mixer until stiff peaks form. Sift brown rice flour, 1\/2 cup white rice flour, cornstarch, baking powder, powdered milk, and a pinch of salt together in a mixing bowl twice. Make a well in the center. Pour in milk, honey, oil, and vanilla extract while lightly stirring. Do not overmix. Fold in egg whites until just combined  leaving pillows of egg whites will create fluffy pockets in the waffles. Cook batter in the waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions, or until waffle is golden brown and the iron stops steaming, about 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter to make 6 waffles. This batter will make 7 total  you can freeze the remaining waffle if desired. Heat maple syrup sauce in the microwave for 1 minute. Place waffles on serving plates. Top each with 3 slices of bacon. Divide chicken between the waffles and top with sauce.","Nutrition":"{\"Calories\": \"716 kcal\", \"Carbohydrates\": \"102 g\", \"Cholesterol\": \"154 mg\", \"Fiber\": \"3 g\", \"Protein\": \"31 g\", \"Saturated Fat\": \"7 g\", \"Sodium\": \"1417 mg\", \"Sugar\": \"33 g\", \"Fat\": \"20 g\", \"Unsaturated Fat\": \"0 g\"}","URL":"https:\/\/www.allrecipes.com\/recipe\/268789\/gluten-free-chicken-and-waffles\/","Ingredient_Names":["chicken tenders","buttermilk","maple syrup","butter","sriracha sauce","superfine white rice flour","eggs","corn flakes","bread crumbs","creole seasoning","salt","black pepper","bacon","oil for frying","whites","cream of tartar","brown rice flour","superfine white rice flour","cornstarch","baking powder","powdered milk","salt","milk","honey","vegetable oil","vanilla extract"],"Ingredient_Names_Text":"chicken_tenders buttermilk maple_syrup butter sriracha_sauce superfine_white_rice_flour eggs corn_flakes bread_crumbs creole_seasoning salt black_pepper bacon oil_for_frying whites cream_of_tartar brown_rice_flour superfine_white_rice_flour cornstarch baking_powder powdered_milk salt milk honey vegetable_oil vanilla_extract","Calories":716.0,"Carbohydrates":102.0,"Cholesterol":154.0,"Fiber":3.0,"Protein":31.0,"Saturated_Fat":7.0,"Sodium":1417.0,"Sugar":33.0,"Fat":20.0,"Unsaturated_Fat":0.0}

Cover bread pudding with aluminum foil and place the baking dish inside a large baking pan. Fill the large pan with warm water so it reaches halfway up the sides of the pudding dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until pudding has puffed up and the center is set, about 45 minutes longer. Remove from the water bath and let stand for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, pour powdered sugar evenly into a heavy saucepan. Cook, without stirring, over medium-high heat until sugar begins to melt and caramelize on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir until all sugar is melted and smooth. Add 1 cup cream, rum, and salt  stir until smooth. Stir in remaining 1\/4 cup cream. Remove from heat and stir in butter until caramel sauce is smooth.
